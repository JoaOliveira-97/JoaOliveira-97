  I graduated in Civil Engineering in 2019 and have been working in the field ever since. Currently, Iâ€™m transitioning into the programming area, which has always been a strong interest of mine. I'm currently studying at EstÃ¡cio University and following Alura's learning programs.
  My focus is on languages like JavaScript and Python, as well as technologies such as HTML and CSS.
  
  I am now looking to start a career in technology. I excel at teamwork and quickly pick up new skills and knowledge needed to complete tasks.

      I've always been drawn to areas involving calculation and logic, which led me to pursue a degree in Civil Engineering, a field i still work in today. Recently, i've been shifting my focus towards programming to engage more directly with technology, something that has always fascinated me.
